// The namespace duelsys.Views contains common view structs that are used from many queries / commands.
// Structs here are intended to be invoked by layers outside the Application Layer, since they live in the Application Layer
// They are stored here to prevent circular dependencies and to not bloat the domain namespace - duelsys
